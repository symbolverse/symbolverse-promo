# Symbol-mind

formally assisted thinking environment

---

## About

A small, humane, calm, **symbolic computing environment** where someone can think more clearly and program things that matter to them.

Not a product nor a platform. More like a **thought interface**. A modern day Lisp, Forth, or Metamath used to formally deduce reliable facts.

A place where someone can sit, write a bit of symbolic code, **express ideas cleanly**, and feel their mind come back into focus.

The **ideas may be documented** and stored for later reflections.

## The Seed

In a world where the majority chases beautiful but complex graphical interfaces, a **small oasis of simplicity and minimalism** arises.

No graphical user interface, only text mode. No millions of colors, only a monochrome tint. Following this setup, the **balanced structure** emerges behind.

We intentionally trade the visual decoration for **clarity of meaning**. Here, unambiguous expressions and transparent interpretation carry the weight that, otherwise, is given to the graphical appearance.

From this seed, and without unnecessary features, we bring the Symbol-mind into existence.

## The Fruits

A lot of intellectual tasks could be performed by Symbol-mind using provided means. Some of the tasks may use *Admissibility Base* (AB) featured in accompanying examples. AB is a simple database for querying specifically patterned S-expression data. It could be used to formalize and simplify choosing the right options among a variety of alternatives.

Other tasks at using Symbol-mind may involve any kinds of formalizations such are resource planning and optimization, truth verifying and proving, or fact checking and producing. Knowing that Symbol-mind is Turing complete computing platform, it follows that it is capable of performing any computation type known to us. But its intention is not to be used in programming usual applications, yet to serve as a truth validation medium hepling in detecting the right facts for solving the right tasks.

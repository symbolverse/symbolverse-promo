# Symbol-OS

formally assisted thinking environment

---

## About

A small, humane, calm, **symbolic computing environment** where someone can think more clearly and program things that matter to them.

Not a product nor a platform. More like a **thought interface**. A modern day Lisp, Forth, or Metamath for deducing trusted chain of facts.

A place where someone can sit, write a bit of symbolic code, **express ideas cleanly**, and feel their mind come back into focus.

---

## Philosophy

In a world where the majority chases beautiful but complex graphical interfaces, a **small oasis of simplicity and minimalism** arises.

No graphical user interface, only text mode. No millions of colors, only a monochrome tint. Following this setup, the **balanced structure** emerges behind.

We intentionally trade the visual decoration for **clarity of meaning**. Here, unambiguous expressions and transparent interpretation carry the weight that, otherwise, is given to the graphical appearance.

From this seed, and without unnecessary features, we bring the Symbol-OS into existence.

## The Vision Ahead

1. The project begins as a minimalist pure **core** backend framework  
2. Stateful **devices** addon makes it become a full stack framework  
3. Finally, it awakens as a monochrome text mode **Symbol-OS**  
   (chat-like command line interface of the symbolic world).
